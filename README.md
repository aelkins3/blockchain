Python / Solidity

The files contained in this Blockchain folder were completed using a Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Smart Contract Developer
course on Udemy.  Python and Postman were used to develop and test the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency elements, while the 
Ethereum Remix IDE was used to develop the smart contract on MyEtherWallet.  All three of these elements, the Blockchain,
Cryptocurrency, and Smart Contract allowed for the buying and selling of Hadcoins.
